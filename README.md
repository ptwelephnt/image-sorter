# Image Sorter

Sorts images based on faces in the image. The application requires the user to add a picture of each face that is going to be used to sort the images, along with the name of the person.

When more than one "Known Face" is identified in a picture, it is moved to a folder with the name of each identified person.

To run, install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Then, run `python main.py`.
